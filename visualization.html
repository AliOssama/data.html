    <p>   Cairo gave five qualities of great visualization, Truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, and enlightening. In my two examples,
    I focus on functionality and beauty of the data visualizations. My good example is taken from an app called "Hello, Sun." that 
    visualizes the sun around the user in an augmented reality. My bad example is a pie graph that talks about the distribution of Genus.
          According to Cairo's principle functionality is accuracy of depiction of data and meaningfulness of the operations of this
    visualization to let people get a good use of it. In the Hello, Sun visualization, the data is collected based on the location
    of the person and the direction/movement of the sun using satellites. This depiction is fairly accurate since it uses good
    resources. For the functionality, using this app is easy since it is an interactive visualization at which the user can change
    the location or the speed of sun movement and then, using the sun depiction, he/she can estimate better what are the best
    photography times, interior designs needed, etc. In the Genus distribution diagram, the data is collected in the blogscnew
    website which is a blogs website that can mean it is not very accurate scientifically. Moreover, the information in this graph
    is so much which affects its functionality leading this pie chart to be useless for the user or the reader. 
          The second quality of comparison is the beauty of both data visualizations. In the Hello, Sun visualization, the picture is 
    really simple because it focuses more on the main goal of the app which is the sun depiction. Because of this simplicity and
    the small scope of colors used, the picture is attractive and pleasing for the users. In the Genus distribution, There are a
    lot of colors that go together but the variation is so high that can lead to even frustration trying to follow all the
    information depicted. 
           A way to help improve my bad example, the Genus distribution pie chart, is to divide the data and remove the percentages from
    the chart. Dividing the data will make it easier for the reader to understand the different proportions on the graph and focus
    on a specific one not all this information together. Removing the percentages will help the user focus on the main aim of a pie
    chart which is the proportion differences between the Genus instead of focusing on numbers. 
           All in all, I used two point that I believe can make data visualization unique which are how beautiful the data is and how
    functional it can be. In my comparison, I talked about an app called Hello, Sun and a distribution of Genus pie chart.
